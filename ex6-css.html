                <p><strong>Quick Summary</strong> - In <a href="https://www.google.com">Part 1</a> of this series, Temani Afif explored different CSS techniques to create tooltip shapes. The main challenge was to rely on a single element and create optimized code that could easily be controlled using CSS variables to update the size, shape, and position of the tail. In this second part, you are going explore more shapes.</p>

                <p>I hope you were able to spend time getting familiar with <a href="https://www.google.com">the techniques we used to create tooltips in Part 1</a> of this quick two-parter. Together, we were able to create a flexible tooltip pattern that supports different directions, positioning, and coloration without adding any complexity whatsoever to the HTML.</a></p>
                <p>We leveraged the CSS border-image property <a href="https://www.google.com">based on another article I wrote</a> while applying clever clip-path tricks to control the tooltip’s tail. If you haven’t checked out that article or the first part of this series, please do because we’re jumping straight into things today, and the context will be helpful.</a></p>
                <p>So far, we’ve looked at tooltip shapes with triangular tails with the option to have rounded corners and gradient coloration. Sure, we were able to do lots of things but there are many other — and more interesting — shapes we can accomplish. That’s what we’re doing in this article. We will handle cases where a tooltip may have a border and different tail shapes, still with the least amount of markup and most amount of flexibility.</p>
                <p>Before we start, I want to remind you that I’ve created <a href="https://www.google.com">a big collection of 100 tooltip shapes.</a> I said in Part 1 that we would accomplish all of them in these two articles. We covered about half of them in Part 1, so let’s wrap things up here in Part 2.</p>
